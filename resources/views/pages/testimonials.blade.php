						<h4><strong>Mwehembana reclaims his land from a corrupt neighbor</strong></h4><br>
						<p>After many years of trying to get back his land, Samson Mwehembana, had  reached a point  of giving  up  his  fight.  Mwehembana,  the  89-year-old  retired  veteran,  has  been  fighting  in  court and spending his daily life in local government offices since 2015, to reclaim his land which was confiscated by his rich and powerful neighbor who, he claims, used his money and influence to bribe  the  courts  to  rule  in  his  favor.  Mzee  Mwehembana  lives  in  Makulu  ward  in  Dodoma Municipality Council.</p>

						<p>Land conflicts are among the common problems in different parts of Tanzania, causing disputes within  community  members  leading  to  confrontations  that  may  result  to  relatives  killing  each other.  These  disputes  in  the  communities  lead  to  insecurity  causing  people  not  to  engage  in their  daily  activities  in  fear  of  their  lives.  This,  in  the  long  run,  affects  the  economy  of  the community in question and, hence, the national output as a whole.</p>

						<p>Mwehembana’s  struggles  became  difficult  because  some  local  authority  officials  are  rooted into  these  land  disputes  and  benefit  from  them  because  they  are  bribed  by  those  who  have money.  This  means  people  like  mzee  Mwehembana  are  deprived  of  their  rights  by  corrupt leaders. 

						After   numerous   attempts   to   claim   his   rightful   property   at   different   levels   from   village leadership to ward officials and, to what he thought was the last resort and savior, the Primary Court  Magistrate.   At  last,  the  alleged  corrupt  rich  guy   in the  ward  won  the  case  and Mwehembana lost, to nobody’s surprise.
						</p>

						<p>One evening, Mwehembana got a visitor at his home, one of his longtime friends. He found the senior  citizens,  mzee  Mwehembana  and  his  lovely  wife,  with  fresh  wounds  of  their  loss  at  the Primary Court. They narrated the sad story to the visitor who, to their surprise, was amused by the outcome of the case! He told them about Makulu Ward Paralegals and how they might help them reclaim what they had considered gone and dusted.
						
						"This  friend  of  mine  advised  us  to  go  and  seek  Makulu  Paralegals’  help  in  our  bid  to  change what we thought was lost hope. I went to them narrated my case to them they agreed to help us," says the old man.
						</p>

						<p>The paralegals reviewed all the documents from  the Primary Court and advised Mwehembana  to file an appeal at the District Court. With the help of these paralegals, the court ruled in the old man’s favor and he got his land back and was compensated a total amount of TShs 380,000.

						Mwehembana  was so  excited  with  this  outcome  saying, "These  boys  are  doing  a  great  deal  of service  to  our  community  as  they  are  helping  poor  people  like  me with  legal  problems  in  our village."

						<h4><strong>Church opposes marriage ceremony of a 16-year old girl </strong></h4><br>
						<p>Parents and relatives had planned to marry an 16-year old girl to an old man in Sikonge district, Tabora region. The parents had presented their request to the Adventists church in the villages and, initially, the church was willing to give in to their wish. 

						Forced  early  marriages  is  a  common  practice  in  most  communities  in  Tanzania,  whereby  most girls  are  deprived  of  their  rights  such  as  the  right  to  education,  and  freedom  of  choice.  This  is mostly due to lack of education on issues about human rights and legal aid.
						</p>

						<p>In  this  case,  Sikonge  Paralegals  took  the  initiative  to  stop  this  marriage  by  empowering  the community members to pressurize the church to stop the marriage taking place.

						The  legal  aid  providers  heard  about  the  marriage  while  conducting  one  of  their  sessions  of public  awareness  on  women  and  human  rights.  They  overheard  the  community  members talking about the marriage of the 16-year old girl which was to take place in the church.

						<p>The  legal  aid  providers  heard  about  the  marriage  while  conducting  one  of  their  sessions  of public  awareness  on  women  and  human  rights.  They  overheard  the  community  members talking about the marriage of the 16-year old girl which was to take place in the church.

						"We decided to intervene and stop this marriage as it was violating the rights of the young girl who was not willing to marry an old man, says Nelson Jackson, the Sikonge district Paralegal.
						</p>

						<p>To  start  with,  the  paralegals  approached  the  girl’s  parents  and  enlightened  them  on  what  the law  says  about  a  girl  aged  below  18  in  reference  to  the  Marriage  Act,  1971.  The  parents  were difficult  to  persuade  as  they  stuck  with  their  decision  to  marry  their  young  daughter  claiming she was idle so marrying her was the only solution.

						One  day,  as  the  congregation  was  proceeding  with  regular  prayers  service  at  the  church, Jackson asked the pastor to give him few minutes to educate church members about marriage and  what  the  law  says  about  it. The  pastor  agreed  and  gave  him  the  floor.  The  paralegal addressed  the  church  members  about  the  dangers  of  early  marriages  referring  to  the  16-year old girl. 
						</p>

						<p>The church finally came to a fair conclusion deciding that they won’t proceed with the marriage ceremony  and  messages  was  delivered  to  other  churches  in  the  village  to  stop  and  condemn the practice.</p>

						<h4><strong>"Luciana saved from her brutal husband   </strong></h4><br>
						<p>My husband is an alcoholic, he is mostly drunk all the time and this leads to him beating me all the  time  sometimes  for  no  reason  at  all,"  says  Luciana  Silumbwe  who  has  bruises  all  her  body due to beatings from one Barton Isaac, her husband. 

						Luciana, aged 25, is a mother of three children living in Ikana village, Ndalambo ward in Momba district, Mbeya region. In December 2015, Luciana was brutally beaten by her husband in front of her children after Barton accused his wife of selling his reserved beer. 
						</p>

						<p>In his attempt to save his mother, the 12-year old Sichalwe tried to intervene but ended up on the receiving end of more beating from his father. Luciana was badly harmed as she almost lost her left eye as a result of the beating. 

						This  habit  had  continued  for  a  long  time  and  the  neighbors knew  of  Barton’s  bad  behavior  of beating  his  wife.  However,  the  December  incident  forced  the  neighbors  to  intervene  as  they now tired of the violent man. After the incident, the husband disappeared as the angry villagers were looking for him claiming his head. 
						</p>

						<p>After  hearing  about  the  incident,  Emanuel  Kidamwina,  a  paralegal,  travelled  to  the  village  and reported  the  incident  to  the  police.  He  took  the  badly  injured  woman  to  the  hospital  for treatment.

						After  listening  to  both  parties,  Emmanuel  was  able  to  resolve the  conflict  by  providing  legal advice, counseling and education. He advised the man and his wife settle their differences and take care of their children. He warned the husband to stop taking excessive alcohol.
